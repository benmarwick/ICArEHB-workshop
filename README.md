# ICArEHB Open Science Seminar, June 2024
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/ICArEHB-workshop/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository contains a Dockerfile to provide RStudio on JupyterHub for the seminar. Click on the ['launch binder'](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/ICArEHB-workshop/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio) button above to open RStudio in your web browser to write and run code in your web browser. Note that no log in required, and file changes do not persist beyond the current session. This is just for practicing and exploring. 

<!-- 
I update the Dockerfile to provide a custom set of R packages to the class so they don't have to install anything. The browser-based instance of RStudio for the class is freely accessible to registered students here: https://jupyter.rttl.uw.edu/2023-spring-archy-488-a/user-redirect/rstudio (UW ID log in required, file storage is attached to your UW ID and persists through the quarter). To make this work for UW-IT, I activate 'Actions' in 'Settings', then trigger a run, e.g. by updating the README, which builds a package hosted on GitHub's container registery. I send the URL of the package to UW-IT. 

If you have a GitHub account, you can also click here to [open a codespaces tab](https://codespaces.new/benmarwick/ICArEHB-open-science-seminar?quickstart=1), wait a few moments for the virtual machine to lauch a customized Visual Studio Code interface in your browser. Then click on the Ports tab (this may take another moment to appear after the instance opens), and clicking on the "globe" icon to open the link. This should open a new tab showing an RStudio login page. The default login user/password here is rstudio/rstudio. Once RStudio opens, consider using File -> New Project
